We'd appreciate it if you had 5min to take this survey, this will help us gauge the amount of compute
resources we'd need to have for the AI4PEX project (both available, and to request new allocations). Very many thanks 
in advance! :beer:

- 1. What datasets are you planning to use in your work in AI4PEX? Choose as many as you like:
  - CMIP6
  - NEMO
  - LSFMIP
  - Climate Digital Twin DestinE
  - EERIE, NextGEMS
  - Mars seasonal forecasts
  - ERA5
  - ESA CCI observations
  - Simulations generated within AI4PEX
  - Not sure (yet)
  - Others (please tell us)
- 2. What data frequencies do your analysis need? Choose as many as you like:
  - monthly
  - daily
  - hourly
  - sub-hourly/minute/higher frequency
- 2b. What spatial resolution will your data be at? Please give us an estimate here:
- 2c. Will your analysis be on a region subset or global? If regional subset, how big (in degrees):
- 3. What variables are you planning to use? Choose as many as you like:
  - atmosphere 2D
  - atmosphere 3D
  - ocean 2D (including sea ice)
  - ocean 3D
- 4. Where do you usually get your data from? Choose as many as you like:
  - ESGF
  - Climate Data Store (CDS)
  - Institution central repository (CEDA/JASMIN, DKRZ...)
  - Others (please tell us)
- 5. Do you plan to move data from any one site to LUMI?
- 6. If the answer to the above question was yes, how much data (in PB) do you need to move to LUMI?
- 7. Do your software tools need a specific file format? Choose as many as you like:
  - Yes, any NetCDF4
  - Yes, NetCDF4 with CF standards
  - Yes, NetCDF4 with CMOR standards
  - Yes, GRIB
  - No, my tool(s) is/are flexible
  - I don't know
- 8. What tools do you usually use to load/process the data? Choose as many as you like:
  - ESMValTool
  - cf-python
  - CDO
  - xarray
  - Generic Python tool with Numpy (realized data)
  - Generic Python tool with Dask (lazy data)
  - others (please tell us)
- 9. How much data (in GB) is usually loaded into memory during a typical runtime job?
- 10. Where do you plan to run the analysis?
  - Wherever I have the data and computing power
  - I plan to download the data and work in my infrastructure
  - Access the data remotely and work interactively
- 11. Where do you usually run/plan to run your analysis? Choose as many as you like:
  - CEDA/JASMIN
  - DKRZ/Levante
  - CSC/LUMI
  - Other (please tell us)
- 12. What type of hardware does your analysis need?
  - Only CPUs
  - Only GPUs
  - Both
- 13. Do you already know what ML/AI will be used and what software do want on LUMI for this? Please tell us here:
- 14. Final question as an open question: please tell us anything else you'd want to communicate w.r.t data.
